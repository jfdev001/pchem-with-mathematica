Exercises in reproducing figures and illustrating concepts from McQuarrie's Quantum Chemistry 2e and McQuarrie's Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach (1997). Repo contains `.m` file to show code, `.nb` if desired to download and run, and `.pdf` to illustrate the figures and results ouput by running `.nb`. Note that the `.m` files were generated from the `.nb` and have odd formatting for the string literals in `Print` statements.
